# Extempore AI Coach

A web application designed to help users improve their extempore speaking skills through AI-powered analysis and feedback.

## Problem Statement

Many people struggle with extempore speaking, which is crucial in various professional and personal scenarios. Existing solutions, while helpful, may not be tailored specifically for extempore speaking or may lack the depth of analysis needed for comprehensive improvement. Extempore AI Coach addresses this gap by providing a focused, intuitive, and extensible platform for users to practice and enhance their off-the-cuff speaking abilities.

## Solution Overview

Extempore AI Coach is a web-based platform that allows users to record their extempore speeches, analyzes them using advanced AI models, and provides detailed, actionable feedback on various aspects of their communication. The platform also includes a dashboard for admins/coaches to monitor user progress and provide additional context. Designed with extensibility in mind, the app can evolve to support other communication scenarios like sales calls, interviews, and negotiations.

## Features

### User Features

- **Recording Interface:** Users can record their video and audio for at least a minute.
- **AI Analysis:** The recorded content is analyzed for:
  - Filler words (e.g., "um," "uh")
  - Conciseness (word count, sentence length)
  - Inclusivity (language used, tone)
  - Confidence level (based on tone, pace, etc.)
  - Energy modulation (variation in pitch and volume)
  - Pace of speech (words per minute)
  - Other essential communication aspects (clarity, articulation, etc.)
- **Actionable Feedback:** Users receive specific, actionable suggestions to improve based on the analysis.
- **Continuous Practice:** After each session, users are presented with a new topic for their next extempore speech.
- **Progress Tracking:** Users can view their improvement over time across multiple sessions.

### Admin/Coach Features

- **Dashboard:** A centralized view of all users' progress, including insights, improvement levels, and analytics.
- **User Profile Management:** Admins can add additional context or nuances to user profiles, which are incorporated into the AI feedback.
- **Notifications:** Admins receive alerts for significant user improvements or areas needing attention.

### Extensibility

- Initially focused on extempore speaking.
- Designed to be extensible for other scenarios like sales calls, negotiations, interviews, YC founder pitches, Ted talks, etc.

## Architecture

- **Frontend:** React.js for a responsive and intuitive user interface.
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js for handling API requests.
- **Database:** MongoDB for storing user data, recordings, and analysis results.
- **AI Models:** Integration with NLP and speech analysis APIs (e.g., Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, IBM Watson, or custom models).
